# My blog based on Astro 

Welcome to my personal IT blog built with Astro! This blog is designed to showcase my articles and projects in a clean, modern, and responsive layout. It uses Markdown for content, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Astro's powerful static site generation capabilities.

Feel free to fork this repository and customize it to suit your needs!

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
